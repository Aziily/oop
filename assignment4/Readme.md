# Personal Diary

## Quick Start

If your platform is windows, you can just run `run.bat` in root directory and begin to use the program.

Otherwise, you need to compile and run by yourself, you can refer to the `bat` file and do something like it.

> P.S.
>
> The g++ used in the `bat` file is gnu, if your compiler is clang, you need to change something.



## An example input of test

Here are some records in `data/dairy.txt`, if you want to delete the records, you can delete the content in it, but not to delete the file or you need to create one and tell the path as a argv of binary file.
