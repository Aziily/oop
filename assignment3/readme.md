# Adventure

## Quick Start

There are only windows's scripts offered, but the logic is simple, you can use commend like what in the *.bat script.

If you want to just test the usage of the program, you can run `run.bat`, which will use such a castle to start adventure, the size is 3x3, start from (1, 1), the princess is at (3, 2) and monster is at (3, 1), and you can leave at (2, 3)

If you want to play the game, you can run `game.bat`, it will use python to generate a random map, which will be printed in the shell, and start game with this generated map. You can enjoy it yourself.

> Warning:
>
> The g++ should be gnu, if it is clang, there is no ganrantee that the scripts can be used
